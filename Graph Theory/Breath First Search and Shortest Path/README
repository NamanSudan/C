 *                        PURPOSE:
 *
 * The purpose of this program is to implement a Graph ADT and 
 * compute Breath First Search and finding Shortest Paths in 
 * Graphs. Graphs are submitted to the program as an input file
 *
 *                        FILES:
 *
 * README - this file
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process
 *
 * List.c - List ADT
 *
 * List.h - List header file
 *
 * FindPath.c - main program, takes input file and creates
 *              a graph and outputs the paths vertecies have
 *              to a new file
 *
 * Graph.h -  Graph header file
 *
 * Graph.c - Graph ADT
 *
 * GraphTest.c - Tester file for Graph ADT
 *
 *            
 *
